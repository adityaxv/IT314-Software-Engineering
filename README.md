## Library Information System.
The scope of the system is to make a Library Information System (LIS) for the benefit of students and employees of the
institute.

Two types of project requirements are 1. Functional Requirements 2. Non-functional requirements

### 1. Functional Requirements:
* Library Management System should be able to ease the difficulty faced in the institute's library. For the library staff, this system
aids them in handling day-to-day book transactions quickly.
* Library Management System must be able to provide any book to a client who wants to issue or purchase it.
* The system should be able to search to book according to Title, Authors, types, number of pages, genre of the book, etc.
* The above feature can be accessed by anyone who wants to issue or purchase a book.
* The librarian, who has administrative privileges and complete control over the system, can enter a new record into
the system when a new book has been purchased, or remove a record in case any book is taken off the shelf.
* The system should store the names of students and the employee who have issued any book or books along with the book name. The user must provide the time of the issue book to be submitted back. If the user is unables to provide the book to the system back on the given time. he must inform to the working group in the LIS or else he will be chareged some penalty per day. For that, there should be a system to count the fine each day for the user if they forgot to return the book on time.
* If the books that user wants to purchase are not available or it has been issued or purchase by another user. He would be informed about it in advance.
* A User can also purchase some purchasable books. Note that not all the books are in the library are purchasable.

### 2. Non-functional Requirements:
* The final deliverable would be a web application using the latest HTML 5. 
* The system should run only within the institute LAN for security. 
* For strong security reasons, a password should be required following features.
    1. the password of the system must have at least 12 characters the more characters, the better.
    2. A mixture of both uppercase and lowercase letters.
    3. A mixture of letters and numbers.
    4. Inclusion of at least one special character, e.g., ! @ # ? ]  
* The password used in the authentication system should be encrypted properly to avoid any cyber attack.
* The system should be scalable to accommodate many user requests.
* It also should be able to store many books' data in the system.


## Deaf Application System
The scope of this application should be for all completely deaf people or partially deaf people. Approximately 5% of the world population (or a staggering 466 million people) suffers from disabling hearing loss. We set out to create an impactful solution for this community that addresses some of their everyday needs.

Two types of requirements of the project are 1. Functional Requirements 2. Non-functional requirements

### Functional Requirements:
* User should able to sense the objects by a custom pattern of vibrations which the user will decide on their own, like different vibrations pattern for carn horn and baby crying noise or other stuff of user requirements. 
* User should add a new vibration pattern by specifying a custom sound. 
* If any harmful object comes very close to the user, then the vibration frequency should increase.
* There should be a username, password, google, Facebook, or discord authentication.
* Users should be able to make a new account by adding their custom username and password.
* It should be a mobile application which uses artificial intelligence to recognize key sound events of interest to this community, such as car horns and babies,
where immediate alerts and continual logging are critical for the user.

### The Non-functional Requirements:
* The AI application should be optimized with low latency by allocating servers and databases in the cloud.
* The password used in the authentication system should be appropriately encrypted to avoid any cyber attack.
* The application should be lite weight and should be scalable.
* The application should be responsive to different sizes of screen.
* The application should run in legacy and the latest android versions.
* This app is optimized for Android with low latency to work in real time.
* No need to waste money to make this system available for computers as the user cannot carry it.
